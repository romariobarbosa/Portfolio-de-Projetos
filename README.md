The main objective of this data science personal project portfolio is to demonstrate my skills in solving business challenges through my knowledge and tools of Data Science.


# Romário Barbosa
<sub>*Data Scientist*</sub>

I have been studying Data Science since 2019, when I started my postgraduate studies in the field. Previously graduated in Computer Networking from WniRuy Wyden. I have carried out several projects to improve my skills and enrich my Project Portfolio.

I have mastered all stages of developing a business solution using Data Science concepts and tools, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I've developed solutions for important business problems such as sales prediction and customer ranking with greater purchase prospects.

Details of each solution are described in the following projects.


**Analytical Tools:**

**Data Collect and Storage:** SQL, MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, Redshift, Snowflake, Oracle, Big Query, MongoDB, Cassandra and Hive.

**Data Processing and Analysis:** R, Python.
Predição
**Development:** Git, Scrum, Lean Analytics and Linux.

**Data Vizualization:** Tableau, Power BI and QlikView.

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clustering, Time Series and Reinforcement Learning.

**Machine Learning Deployment:** AWS Cloud and Google Cloud Platform ( GCP )

## Data Science Projects:

### [Sales Prediction]( https://github.com/romariobarbosa/sales-predict-mobile )

Creating a machine learning model capable of predicting how much each store will sell in the next 6 weeks, this challenge comes from a need for the CFO to determine the budget to carry out store renovations. In this project I developed an XGBoost model, which had an error of 0.093% on average.
